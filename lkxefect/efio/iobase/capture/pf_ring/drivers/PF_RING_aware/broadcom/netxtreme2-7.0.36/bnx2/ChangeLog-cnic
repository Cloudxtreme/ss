    New 7.0 FW: bnx2x, cnic, bnx2i, bnx2fc
    
    New FW/HSI (7.0):
     - Added support to 578xx chips
     - Improved HSI - much less driver's direct access to the FW internal
       memory needed.
    
    New implementation of the HSI handling layer in the bnx2x (bnx2x_sp.c):
     - Introduced chip dependent objects that have chip independent interfaces
       for configuration of MACs, multicast addresses, Rx mode, indirection table,
       fast path queues and function initialization/cleanup.
     - Objects functionality is based on the private function pointers, which
       allows not only a per-chip but also PF/VF differentiation while still
       preserving the same interface towards the driver.
     - Objects interface is not influenced by the HSI changes which do not require
       providing new parameters keeping the code outside the bnx2x_sp.c invariant
       with regard to such HSI chnages.
    
    Changes in a CNIC, bnx2fc and bnx2i modules due to the new HSI.

    cnic: Improve NETDEV_UP event handling
    
    During NETDEV_UP, we use symbol_get() to get the net driver's cnic
    probe function.  This sometimes doesn't work if NETDEV_UP happens
    right after NETDEV_REGISTER and the net driver is still running module
    init code.  As a result, the cnic device may not be discovered.  We
    fix this by probing on all NETDEV events if the device's netif_running
    state is up.

    cnic: Fix rtnl deadlock
    
    When cnic_stop_hw() -> cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() is called under rtnl_lock()
    from NETDEV_DOWN event, it waits for cnic_delete_task() to complete.
    It will deadlock when cnic_delete_task() takes rtnl_lock() before
    calling cnic_ulp_stop_one().
    
    We fix it by removing the rtnl_lock() in cnic_delete_task().
    cnic_ulp_stop_one() has mutex and atomic bit ops to prevent important
    operations from being done more than once, so it is not necessary to take
    rtnl_lock().

    Broadcom CNIC core network driver: fix mem leak on allocation failures in cnic_alloc_uio_rings()
    
    We are leaking memory in drivers/net/cnic.c::cnic_alloc_uio_rings() if
    either of the calls to dma_alloc_coherent() fail. This patch fixes it by
    freeing both the memory allocated with kzalloc() and memory allocated with
    previous calls to dma_alloc_coherent() when there's a failure.
    
    Thanks to  Joe Perches <joe@perches.com>  for suggesting a better
    implementation than my initial version.

    cnic: Decouple uio close from cnic shutdown
    
    During cnic shutdown, the original driver code requires userspace to
    close the uio device within a few seconds.  This doesn't always happen
    as the userapp may be hung or otherwise take a long time to close.  The
    system may crash when this happens.
    
    We fix the problem by decoupling the uio structures from the cnic
    structures during cnic shutdown.  We do not unregister the uio device
    until the cnic driver is unloaded.  This eliminates the unreliable wait
    loop for uio to close.
    
    All uio structures are kept in a linked list.  If the device is shutdown
    and later brought back up again, the uio strcture will be found in the
    linked list and coupled back to the cnic structures.

    cnic: Defer iscsi connection cleanup
    
    The bnx2x devices require a 2 second quiet time before sending the last
    RAMROD command to destroy a connection.  This sleep wait adds up to a
    long delay when iscsid is serially destroying maultiple connections.
    
    Create a workqueue to perform the final connection cleanup in the
    background to speed up the process.  This significantly speeds up the
    process as the wait time can be done in parallel for multiple connections.

    So that bnx2i can handle the error condition immediately and not have to
    wait for timeout.

    net-next: remove useless union keyword
    
    remove useless union keyword in rtable, rt6_info and dn_route.
    
    Since there is only one member in a union, the union keyword isn't useful.

    cnic: Fix context memory init. on 5709.
    
    We need to zero context memory on 5709 in the function cnic_init_context().
    Without this, iscsid restart on 5709 will not work because of stale data.
    TX context blocks should not be initialized by cnic_init_context() because
    of the special remapping on 5709.

    cnic: Return SPQ credit to bnx2x after ring setup and shutdown.
    
    Everytime the iSCSI ring finishes setup or shutdown, we need to return
    the SPQ (slow path queue) credit to the bnx2x driver.  Without this step,
    the SPQ will eventually be full causing iSCSI to fail.  This can happen
    after 3 or 4 MTU changes for example.
    
    Add code to wait for these slow path commands to complete in the RX ring
    and return the SPQ credit to bnx2x.

    drivers/net: Remove unnecessary returns from void function()s
    
    This patch removes from drivers/net/ all the unnecessary
    return; statements that precede the last closing brace of
    void functions.
    
    It does not remove the returns that are immediately
    preceded by a label as gcc doesn't like that.
    
    It also does not remove null void functions with return.
    
    Done via:
    $ grep -rP --include=*.[ch] -l "return;\n}" net/ | \
      xargs perl -i -e 'local $/ ; while (<>) { s/\n[ \t\n]+return;\n}/\n}/g; print; }'
    
    with some cleanups by hand.
    
    Compile tested x86 allmodconfig only.

    cnic: Fix locking in start/stop calls.
    
    The slow path ulp_start and ulp_stop calls to the bnx2i driver
    are sleepable calls and therefore should not be protected using
    rcu_read_lock.  Fix it by using mutex and setting a bit during
    these calls.  cnic_unregister_device() will now wait for the bit
    to clear before completing the call.

    cnic: Refine registration with bnx2.
    
    Register and unregister with bnx2 during NETDEV_UP and NETDEV_DOWN
    events.  This simplifies the sequence of events and allows locking
    fixes in the next patch.

    cnic: Fix symbol_put_addr() panic on ia64.
    
    When the cnic driver tries to grab a symbol from bnx2 when bnx2 is
    running init code, symbol_get() will succeed but symbol_put_addr()
    will hit BUG() a moment later.  module_text_address() fails because
    bnx2 is still in init code.
    
    This is fixed by using symbol_put() instead which does the exact
    opposite of symbol_get().

    cnic: Fix ISCSI_KEVENT_IF_DOWN message handling.
    
    When a net device goes down or when the bnx2i driver is unloaded,
    the code was not generating the ISCSI_KEVENT_IF_DOWN message
    properly and this could cause the userspace driver to crash.
    
    This is fixed by sending the message properly in the shutdown path.
    cnic_uio_stop() is also added to send the message when bnx2i is
    unregistering.

    This reverts commit bc3bf8fd330ce981ce632a1a4a283eee46838f32.
    
    All the commit did was add a second #include of <linux/module.h> which is
    the wrong fix.

    [SCSI] cnic: Add new Broadcom CNIC driver.
    
    The CNIC driver controls BNX2 hardware rings and resources used by
    iSCSI.  Most hardware resources for iSCSI are separate from those
    used for ethernet networking.
    
    iSCSI uses a separate MAC address and IP address.  The CNIC driver
    creates a UIO interface to handle the non-offloaded packets such as
    ARP, etc in userspace.
