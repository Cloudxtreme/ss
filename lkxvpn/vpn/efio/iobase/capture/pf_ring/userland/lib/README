User-Space Ring
---------------

As of PF_RING 5.3 you can use user-space rings so that two apps
can send/receive packets by communicating directly. In order to
do that the following steps are necessary

1. Start receiver that creates a user-space ring
   pfcount -i usr0

2. Start receiver that attaches to the previously created user-space ring
   pfsend -i userspace:usr0
